# Pitfalls in Image Detection: Solutions that Rock!

I explore how image classification systems make errors, and propose remedial solutions. The workflow is split between three independent jupyter notebooks. Each notebook trains a nueral net, which is very taxing on memory. If running the notebooks, I recommend that you close each notebook completely before starting the next one. A powerful GPU and the appropriate drivers is also recommended. See the [PyTorch documentation](https://pytorch.org/docs/master/cuda.html) for more details.
